It's embarrassing, especially cuz Cosmo has long time guests who used to love us, and now they say they will stay somewhere else next time. Our tips went down.

1.0,"Unfriendly, heavy workload, racism",Union benefits medical healthcare is nice,They give you 1 day of training outside of the classroom and then set you free. Managers sneak into rooms before assigned and steal your tips from each room as well as housemen. They can select exactly who gets what assignments and they usually do not favor anyone who is not hispanic. Its very easy to tell how management feels about their staff especially top supervisors. You are on call for all shifts all the time. You only have a 15 min grace period to respond back to them if you miss schedulings call. They will conduct inspections on whoever they want at any point and make up reasons to fail you if they want to. They all talk and they know exactly what they’re doing. These rooms are old and dusty and heavy dust in the vents causes cleaned rooms to accumulate dust very quickly. The sheets are 80% stained by clean. Most maids do not toss them they just recycle them back into population which is terrible to have to load tour cart with stained linen for nothing. Most use white out to touch up the stains. It’s a ruthless job of having to accept abuse from people who probably couldnt even meet the expectations themselves of 10-15 checkouts per day.
